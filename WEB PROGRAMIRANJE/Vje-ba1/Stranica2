    <h2>Marvel Confirms Death Of Major Spider-Man Character</h2>
    <p>There are some heavy revelations in this week's issue of Venom, but one of the biggest ones is the reveal that one particular Spider-Man character is truly dead.

      Spoilers incoming for Venom #7, so if you haven't read the issue yet you've been warned.

      Eddie Brock finds himself being interrogated by The Maker, who is (or was now that its gone) the Ultimate Universe's version of Reed Richards. Brock isn't quite sure how he got here, and after The Maker figures that out, he is happy to fill in the blanks.

      Unfortunately, most of the news he has for Brock is bad news, including the fact that while the symbiote is still attached to Brock, the personality and mind of it has been mostly wiped away after Brock's last encounter. As Maker points out, that means it is little more than a guard dog, as it will still protect him but the personality is not there any longer, signified by the fact that he says I instead of We now.
